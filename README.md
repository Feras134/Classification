# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project builds a predictive system for detecting the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical data. A variety of machine learning models — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, and others — were trained, evaluated, and compared to determine the most accurate model. Data preprocessing techniques like one-hot encoding and min-max normalization were applied to ensure the models could effectively learn from the input features.

## Objectives
- Predict heart disease presence using supervised learning.
- Compare the performance of multiple classification models.
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.
- Visualize model results using bar charts and confusion matrices.

## Setup / Installation Instructions
1. **Ensure that you have jupyter notebook**:
   - you can download it or use VS code.
     
2. **Ensure that you have the necessary libraries (pandas-Numpy-matplotlib-seaborn-scikit-learn-XGBClassifier-LGBMClassifier)**:
   - Or you can just see the results directly without running cells.

3. **Ensure the dataset file is present**:
   - Place `heart.csv` in the root directory of the project.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open the file.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Execute the notebook**:
   - Run all cells sequentially to see preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualizations.
   - Accuracy scores and model comparisons will be shown along with confusion matrices.

## Output

- Model Accuracy Comparisons
- Confusion Matrices for Each Model
- Hyperparameter Tuning Results
- Final Recommendation of the Best Performing Model
