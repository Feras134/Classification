# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project builds a predictive system for detecting the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical data. A variety of machine learning models — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, and others — were trained, evaluated, and compared to determine the most accurate model. Data preprocessing techniques like one-hot encoding and min-max normalization were applied to ensure the models could effectively learn from the input features.

## Objectives
- Predict heart disease presence using supervised learning.
- Compare the performance of multiple classification models.
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.
- Visualize model results using bar charts and confusion matrices.

## Setup / Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository or download the files**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm
   ```

3. **Ensure the dataset file is present**:
   - Place `heart.csv` in the root directory of the project.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open `CSC489 FINALL.ipynb`.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Execute the notebook**:
   - Run all cells sequentially to see preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualizations.
   - Accuracy scores and model comparisons will be shown along with confusion matrices.

3. **Modify or extend**:
   - You can add new models, try different preprocessing techniques, or experiment with cross-validation strategies.
